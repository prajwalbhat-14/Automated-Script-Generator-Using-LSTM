# Automated-Script-Generator-Using-LSTM
This project explores LSTM networks for automatic script generation by gathering genre-based scripts, building models, and evaluating narrative coherence. LSTMs address RNNs' long-term dependency issues, enabling the creation of tools to generate contextually relevant and creative scripts based on user prompts or genres.
